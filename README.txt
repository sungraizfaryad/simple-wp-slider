This is a simple plugin that can be used to display slider anywhere on the website using shortcode.

== Description ==

I have gone through the wp plugins org but could not find a simple slider plugin that just show the slider. So, i decided to build one.

== Installation ==

The installation is simple

e.g.

1. Upload `simple-wp-slider.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go To `Settings > Simple WP Slider`.
4. Now you can use the images using options. You can also reorder using arrow icon.
5. Once you are done with the images upload, use the `[simplewpslider]`shortcode to display the slider.
